# TIPS Interpreter in C++ / Flex
This program was written in the fall semester of 2021 for CSE 4714/6714 - Programming languages.

<ins>**Authors:**</ins> The class instructor wrote most of driver.cpp and the makefile. The files parser_tree_nodes.h, lexer.h, prodcutions.h, and rules.l were written by myself, Grant Doty.

The purpose of this program is to accept a .pas file containing TIPS code, which is a subset of the language Pascal, and to parse, interpret, and return a result. If an error is found in the code it will halt the program and return an error with the error type and line number. Sample input and output files can be found in the Sample_Inputs_and_Outputs folder
